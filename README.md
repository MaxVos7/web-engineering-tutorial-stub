# Vue as an api consumer
Vue is a javascript framework that makes it easier to show data fetches from an api at the page.
Vue lets you bind html tags to javascript data elements, in two ways. That means that you can change 
the data in javascript and it will reflect the change on the page in real time. And it lets the user change
values in the html which will be reflected in real time in the javascript. This would be very difficult to obtain yourself
in vanilla javascript.
